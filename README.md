# Git Init

Welcome to PDX Code Guild's Git 101 workshop. By the end of the workshop, you should be comfortable with:

- cloning repos from Github
- creating a new branch
- applying changes
- making commits
- pushing your branch up to Github
- creating pull requests
- and keeping your master branch up to date

## Getting Started
Code along with Lisa as she solves the infamous [Rock, Paper, Scissors](/labs/rps.md) lab from Programming 101!
