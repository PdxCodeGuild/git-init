## why pull requests?

A pull request allows a developer to apply a new feature or fix they wrote to the working version of the app. After creating a pull request, a team lead or team member (in your case, your teacher) will review the code and if it's satisfactory, your branch will be merged into master for EVERYONE to pull.

_After merging, EVERYONE on your team will have the code you wrote._

**Note**: on large teams, branches are merged into a "devlopment" branch for testing before merged to master (production).

## how to create a pull request

**Fun Fact**: Git's push success message is very helpful because it provides a Github link for you to create a pull request!

1. Copy and paste the link into your browser. Navigate to web page.

2. Edit pull request title.

  Make sure it's a clear summary. If you have any other notes, you can add it to the body. If you have any questions or comments for your teacher, you can tag them here.

3. Save

  Save the pull request and for now you're done! From here, your teacher or team lead will review your code. If it is satisfactory, they will merge it to Master.
