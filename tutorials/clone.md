[Back to Syllabus](/README.md)

1. Navigate to to the main page of the <a href="https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/git-init">Git Init Repo</a>.

2. Click on **Clone or download** and select the clipboard to copy the repo link.

3. Open up a terminal window and navigate to where you'd like to save this repo. I like to use a **projects** folder on my **Desktop**.

cd git-init
