# Pushing to Github
[Back to Syllabus](/README.md)

Now that you've completed your work and all your files are commited, let's push your branch up to Github.

## <a id="push"></a>Push to Github

1. Double check that you don't have any stray files.

```bash
git status
```
If you have uncommited files, please go back to the last step to [commit your files](commit.md).

2. Double check that you are on the correct branch

```bash
git branch
```

3. Push up to Github!

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```
