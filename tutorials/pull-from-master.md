## <a id="master"></a>Pull from Master

[Back to Syllabus](/README.md)

Once a pull request is approved and branches are merged into Master, your teacher or team lead will alert you to pull from master (usually in a group chat like Slack). When that happens, follow the steps below to keep your master up to date.

1. In your terminal, make sure you're on your master branch.

```bash
git branch
```

2. Make sure you don't have any stray files.

```bash
git status
```

3. Pull the latest changes from master.

```bash
git pull
```

You now have the latest version of the master branch on your computer.
